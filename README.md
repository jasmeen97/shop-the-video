# Shop the Video – Autogenerator

“Shop the Video” Autogenerator is a project intended to automatically turn video content into shoppable experiences. The idea is to detect or define products inside a video, then generate interactive elements (links, overlays, or product carousels) that viewers can click to purchase or learn more.

## Project Status

- Repository initialized scaffold only.
- Core code and implementation details still to be added.

## Possible Features (to refine later)

- Ingest videos from platforms (file upload, YouTube URL, etc.).
- Detect timestamps where products appear.
- Attach product metadata (title, price, URL, images).
- Generate “shop-the-video” widgets or embed code for websites.
- Export configuration (JSON or API) for frontends or e‑commerce platforms.

## Getting Started

1. Initialize git (if not already):
   ```bash
   git init
   ```
2. Add files for your implementation (e.g., backend, frontend, or scripts).
3. Commit your changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit for Shop the Video Autogenerator"
   ```

## Next Steps

- Decide on tech stack (e.g., Node.js, Python, or a no-code automation layer).
- Design data model for videos, products, and interactions.
- Implement the first minimal prototype (e.g., manually defined timestamps + product links).
